Here are the steps required to backup the Fuhu Nabi 2, install a custom recovery, root, and gapps using Ubuntu(12.10) Linux.
Original root and recovery credit go to jmztaylor from this thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/show....php?t=1905674
You should do all of the OTA updates before rooting(otherwise you might lose WiFi) When I posted this the latest version was 1.9.37. Settings>About Tablet>Update>Check Update
Download the needed files then extract all of the files to your home folder to begin. https://www.box.com/s/f8toudd1y8cm2omh14v2

Open a terminal(ctrl+alt+t) and run the following command to install ADB and Fastboot (Universe Repos - Changeable in Software Sources).
Code:

sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot

On the device, enable USB debugging in Settings>Developer options, then connect USB cable.
Just in case the adb server is already running, lets kill it using:
Code:

adb kill-server

Now we will start the server and reboot the device:
Code:

sudo adb reboot-bootloader

Once the device has rebooted into the bootloader, we will flash the new recovery image using fastboot:
Code:

sudo fastboot flash recovery recovery.img

When fastboot is finished, boot the new recovery kernel on the Nabi2 by pressing vol+ then vol-(down to recovery) then vol+ to select.


We will push the follwing files to the device.
First we will push the Root file.
Code:

adb push root.zip /sdcard/root.zip

Now we will push the Google Apps File
Code:

adb push gapps.zip /sdcard/gapps.zip

This is the script that will backup then install Root and Google Apps onto the device.(you can also skip the script and do it manually if you like, but make sure you do a backup)
Code:

adb push backup-root-gapps.openrecoveryscript /cache/recovery/openrecoveryscript

Now we will reboot the device and let the script do it's thing.
Code:

adb reboot recovery

Your Fuhu Nabi2 is now rooted, w/gapps, and a custom recovery

NOTE: The following is if you ever need to do an OTA update, which requires the original Nabi2 recovery.
Download the original Nabi2 recovery image to your home folder https://www.box.com/s/9ogqkk8uu71bqrnpz9w1
Reboot the device into the bootloader
Code:

sudo adb reboot-bootloader

Finally we will flash the original recovery image to the device
Code:

sudo fastboot flash recovery nabi2_original_recovery.img
